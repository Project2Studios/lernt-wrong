# Source Implementation Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how to implement the comprehensive source system for your "What Did You Learn That Isn't True?" app. Three specialized research agents have compiled **20+ credible academic sources** covering astronomy, physics, biology, medicine, psychology, technology, and social sciences.

## âœ… What's Been Completed

### 1. Frontend Updates
- **Type definitions**: Added `source?` and `sourceUrl?` fields to `OutdatedFact` interface
- **FactCard component**: Updated to display sources with clickable links and external link icons
- **API transformation**: Updated facts endpoint to include source fields from database

### 2. Database Schema
- **Schema update**: Added `source` and `source_url` columns to facts table
- **Migration script**: Created `database/add-sources-migration.sql` for safe column addition

### 3. Research Compilation
- **20+ Sources**: Comprehensive academic sources from peer-reviewed journals
- **Population script**: Ready-to-run script with all researched sources
- **Quality standards**: Nobel Prize research, landmark studies, major medical journals

## ðŸš€ Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration
```bash
# Connect to your Neon database and run:
psql [your_neon_connection_string] -f database/add-sources-migration.sql
```

### Step 2: Install Script Dependencies
```bash
npm install dotenv
```

### Step 3: Run Source Population Script
```bash
# Check what facts need sources
node scripts/populate-sources.js list

# Update database with researched sources
node scripts/populate-sources.js update
```

### Step 4: Verify Implementation
```bash
# Start your dev server and check fact cards display sources
npm run dev
```

## ðŸ“Š Expected Results

### Database Updates
- **20+ facts** will have credible academic sources
- **Source links** will be clickable with external link icons
- **Citations** follow standard academic format

### User Experience
- **Enhanced credibility** through visible academic sources
- **Educational value** increased with direct links to research
- **Trust building** through transparent source attribution

### Source Quality Standards
- âœ… **Peer-reviewed journals**: JAMA, NEJM, Nature, Science, Psychological Science
- âœ… **Nobel Prize research**: H. pylori discovery, cosmic microwave background
- âœ… **Official organizations**: IAU, USDA, USPSTF, WHO
- âœ… **Landmark studies**: Original research that changed scientific understanding
- âœ… **DOI links**: Permanent academic links where available

## ðŸ”„ Future Expansion

### Adding More Sources
1. **Research new facts**: Use the established methodology for finding original research
2. **Update script**: Add new sources to `factSources` object in populate-sources.js
3. **Run update**: Execute the script to update database
4. **Quality check**: Ensure sources meet peer-review standards

### Source Categories
The current implementation covers:
- **Hard Sciences**: Physics, astronomy, chemistry, biology
- **Medical Sciences**: Clinical medicine, nutrition, health policy
- **Social Sciences**: Psychology, education, technology studies
- **Methodology**: Original research, meta-analyses, landmark studies

## ðŸ“‹ Quality Assurance Checklist

Before deploying:
- [ ] Database migration completed successfully
- [ ] All 20+ sources populate correctly
- [ ] Source links are clickable and functional
- [ ] DOI links resolve to correct papers
- [ ] Citation format is consistent
- [ ] External link icons display properly
- [ ] Mobile display works correctly

## ðŸŽ¯ Impact

This implementation transforms your app from entertainment into an **educational resource** by:
1. **Providing evidence** for every scientific correction
2. **Building user trust** through transparent sourcing
3. **Enabling verification** via direct links to research
4. **Supporting learning** with access to original studies
5. **Demonstrating quality** through rigorous academic standards

The systematic research approach using specialized agents has created a comprehensive foundation that can be extended to cover all facts in your database with the same level of academic rigor.
